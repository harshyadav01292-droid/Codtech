# 🏠 Smart Home Light Control Using ESP32

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an IoT-based Smart Home Light Control System using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system allows users to remotely switch a light (represented by an LED in simulation) ON and OFF through the Blynk IoT platform over a Wi-Fi connection. The project is simulated using Wokwi, making it easy to test without physical hardware.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn the basics of Internet of Things (IoT).
- Connect an ESP32 to Wi-Fi.
- Interface the ESP32 with the Blynk IoT platform.
- Remotely control a light using a smartphone.
- Simulate the complete project using Wokwi.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The ESP32 connects to the Wokwi Wi-Fi network.
2. It authenticates with the Blynk Cloud using the project Auth Token.
3. A button widget in the Blynk mobile app sends values to Virtual Pin V0.
4. The ESP32 receives the command.
5. The LED connected to GPIO 2 turns ON or OFF accordingly.
6. This simulates controlling a home light remotely over the internet.
